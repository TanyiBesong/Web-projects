            <h2> Introduction </h2>
            <p> Along with everything else out there, social media also has two sides to it. 
            There are pros and cons to using social media. The two sides can be described in terms of business, marketing, networking, and economy.

            <h2> Bright Side </h2>
            <p> Let's see the positive, The process of getting <b>up to date</b> and being updated on the latest news around the world is a lot faster. 
            There is very little downtime from the time that you pick up social media to when you start scrolling through it. When it comes to business, 
            <b>involvement and engagement</b> with the customer is easier than it was in the past. Getting feedback from them is more accessible as 
            we do not need a middle person. 
            Because the reception of feedback is faster, updating products comes easier. The customers can 
            simply give feedback and those inputs will be used to improve the businesses performance and products 
            <i>(making both the customer and the provider happy). </i>
            Social media platforms provide a way to collaborate among a wide range of <b>diverse</b> people. 
            Spending money on TV ads or other marketing schemes is a great strategy, but that time and money can be <b>saved and
             invested</b> into social media which will in turn enhance the growth of the company. <br>The best part of it is that people have their 
             own space and time. There is no need for an office as <b>everything is online,</b> and the market will still be large. 
            It reduces the stress and money needed to hold a physical location.<br>  On top of that, 
            research is easier and <b>growth is exponential</b> (smaller level businesses and global businesses can use social media).
            When it comes to networking, even the law enforcement use social media to catch and prosecute criminals. Networking or 
            </b>communicating large events</b>like a party or a global pandemic provides <b>a mainstream</b> way of spreading information. 
            Because there is more access to learning sources, <b>the education system improves.</b> This access to learning sources provides a wide 
            spectrum of options from general knowledge to more complex and professional knowledge. Ultimately, the community grows from social media.

            <h2> Dark Side </h2>
            <p> Second, the negative. The business market is enormous, 
            so the scale of the research has to be the same level. 
            Increasing <b>the difficulty</b> of the last point, businesses also have to worry about the diversity of their customers. 
            Social media can go <b>out of control.</b> One small mistake can turn into a scandal in the eyes of the people using the platform. 
            Understanding varies from person to person (let's not forget <b>the translation</b> from language to language as well). 
            <br>The line between professional and personal marketing can be <b>blurry</b>. This line differs from person to person as everyone’s 
            <b>interpretation</b> will not be the same. For an example, an unfamiliar person might send a laughing emoji for a sad event 
            (they thought they were “crying”). Social media is a huge risk. Once the information is shared, there is no going back on it. 
            Suppose a company is selling a product and advertising it on social media, 
            it is possible to make a hiccup in the process and share something <b>inappropriate.</b>
             That same company can get a lot of likes on their product but only get a few link clicks or purchases. 
             What further complicates the process is changing trends. <b>Trends change so fast, </b>it makes your head spin. 
             It's too hard to keep up with them. Another problem with social media is <b>the complications </b>that can occur.
              Those include <b>unreliable information,</b> too much authority to the user (wikipedia), data privacy, government and citizen exposure,
               marketing races, and unstable job opportunities. <b>The side effects are cyberbullying,</b> less human interaction, and the authenticity of military,
                journalism, and activists. All in all, whichever path a person decides to go with in terms of social media, they need to be wise and think about all of the sides.

            drawbacks that come with it.
